# NUSearch User Guide

NUSearch is a **desktop app for consolidating NUS professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and students’ profiles, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, NUSearch add and search for your NUS peers and mentors faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Motivation
We aim to simplify the process of accessing academic information by developing an efficient directory app. This app will help students to consolidate professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and their fellow classmates’ profile, improving the ease of accessing the details of individuals whom the students might need to contact for that semester.

## Unique Selling Point
The app helps students to consolidate important data, such as profiles of professors, teaching assistants (TAs), and fellow classmates, providing students with a single platform that is compact and easy to navigate. With this application, students can save time and energy that would otherwise be spent searching for scattered and hard-to-access essential academic contacts. The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it convenient for users to quickly find the information they need.

## Quick start

## UI Mockup

Here's a mockup of how the User Interface might look: <br>

![NUSearch UI Mockup](./images/Ui.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
