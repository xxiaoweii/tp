### Project: NUSearch

NUSearch is a desktop application used for consolidating NUS professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and students’ profiles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, it has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

##### Search Feature
* What it does: The search function is divided into 4 subcommands : search, searchrole, searchcourse, 
and searchtutorial. It allows the users to search and filter through the list people based on their 
name, role, course as well as tutorial.  
* Justification: This feature allows the user to easily find the contact information of one based on 
one of the 4 categories. 

##### FavList Feature
* What it does: It allows the user to easily access the list of favourited persons with a single simple 
command. 
* Justification: This feature allows users to access their favourite list, which typically contains 
the information of those they frequently search for quickly.

##### Project management

##### Enhancements to existing features
The existing implementation of the find command only allowed the user to search by the name in 
the address book. However, my new implementation of the feature allows the user to search for a person
or multiple people at once based on their name, role, course or tutorial class.
