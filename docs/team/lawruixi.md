### Project: NUSearch

NUSearch is a desktop application used for consolidating NUS professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and students’ profiles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, it has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

##### **New Features**: 
- Added relevant classes to be used by the Person model:
 - `Contact`
 - `Role`
 - `Course`
 - `Tutorial`
- Updated the Person model, as well as all other places in the entire codebase, to use the aforementioned classes instead.
- Added an autocomplete feature, as well as changing the UI appropriately to support it.

##### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a bug that arose where new code was written based on outdating code on a newer branch, resulting in compilation failure Pull Requests.
- Fixed 27 bugs related to the User Guide.
- Most of these are typos.
- But some are pretty large and required rewriting entire sections of the User Guide; see **Documentation** below.
- Fixed a bug where roles weren't being saved properly.
- Fixed a bug where data was not saved upon exiting the app.
- Fixed a bug with autocomplete where the user could not move the cursor in the text field.
- Fixed a bug where searchcourse produced the wrong error message if called with no arguments.
